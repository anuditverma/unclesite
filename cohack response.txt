Redesign the UX for stayuncle.com

Our initial reactions to the problem statement
- Why only weather?
- Is the company expecting only UI changes?
- Can we hack a better user flow?

Our take on the problem
- The target customer base is people on official trips
- UX is not only about the UI
- UX is how the company's value proposition is communicated to the user
- We wanted to explain the product in a better way than the original site
- We wanted to add little more features and give the user a full fledged user experience

What we hoped to achieve
- Smoother user flow
- Better understand of the product

What are the challenges we faced?
- Too much creative freedom forced us to spend a lot of time on thinking
- Internal compulsiveness to implement geolocation & geocoding & actually implementing it

What have we done?
- Recreated a static workflow for the site with additional features

What is left?
- Implement backend
- Improve UI design

Overall experience
- Made a lot of mistakes
- Learnt what not to do
- Had a fun time
- Was a race against time
